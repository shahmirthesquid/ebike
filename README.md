## Frame
The frame of my bike is a Schwinn Biggity DLX Men's Hardtail 26x4.0 Mountain Bike from Canadian Tire. I bought this frame entirely with Canadian Tire money points :)
This was a really great steel construction. The stock dropouts handed my 2kW motor for 6months before opening. Which is impressive that it lasted that long. Good thing about steel is its ductility so I was able to hammer the rear dropouts back into shape.

## Custom Rear Dropout Torque Arms
Due to the large rotational forces on the dropouts from the hub motor axle, the dropouts can open and release the rear wheel from the bike. This happened to me at 2am in a sketchy area of downtown and I had to walk my bike home for hours :( 
I have designed two heavy duty torque arms. One for the braking side, and one for the nonbraking side, to ensure that this never happens again. These are 3D models along with engineering drawings that can be given to any CNC service to cheaply construct the part. I used PCBWay to CNC cut my torque arms.
These torque arm designs are custom made for the Schwinn Biggity DLX mentioned above. This may work on other bikes, this may not. Please 3D print a model first and check fitment before ordering a steel CNC cut version.

### Drive/Non-braking Side
All of these took an extreme amount of trial and error

I think I forgot to take a picture of this torque arm when it came in. I just installed it and rode, but it looks like the 3d print above and has the screw to tighten onto the axle like the next torque arm.
